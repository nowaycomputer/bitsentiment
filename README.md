# bitsentiment
An analysis of bitcoin price movements based on web sentiment

Initial ideas: scrape bitcoin price from various exchanges:

https://bitpay.com/bitcoin-payment-gateway-api

https://blockchain.info/api

https://localbitcoins.com/api-docs/public/

https://www.bitstamp.net/api/

https://coinbase.com/docs/api/overview

https://coinbase.com/api/doc/1.0/prices/buy.html

https://coinbase.com/api/v1/prices/spot_rate

https://www.kraken.com/help/api

https://www.bitfinex.com/pages/api

https://www.cryptsy.com/pages/api

Use NLTK or other sentiment analysis to scrape sentiment from:

Twitter
Finviz
Others?

Attempt to identify any patterns between changes in sentiment and the (presumably) laggy price changes as people buy and sell bitcoin in response
